# PatchLang

A domain-specific language for describing signal flow in broadcast and live production environments. Human-readable, git-diffable, LLM-friendly.

```patch
template Rio3224 {
  meta { manufacturer: "Yamaha"  model: "Rio3224"  category: "Stagebox" }
  ports {
    Dante_Pri: io(etherCON) [Dante, primary]
    Mic_In[1..32]: in(XLR)
    Line_Out[1..16]: out(XLR)
  }
  bridge Mic_In -> Dante_Pri
}

instance Stage_Left is Rio3224 { location: "Stage Left Wing" }
connect Stage_Left.Dante_Pri -> FOH.Dante_Pri { cable: "Cat6a"  length: "30m" }
bridge Stage_Left.Mic_In[1..32] -> FOH.Dante_Ch[1..32]
```
